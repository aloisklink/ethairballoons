# EthAir Balloons
<img src="logo_official.png" width="300">
A strictly typed ORM library for Ethereum blockchain.
It allows you to use Ethereum blockchain as a persistent storage in an organized and model-oriented way <strong>without writing custom complex Smart contracts</strong>.
<strong>Note:</strong> As transaction fees may be huge, it is strongly advised to only deploy EthAir Balloons models in private Ethereum blockchains or locally using
``` ganache-cli```
